# Cron John Silver 🏴‍☠️ 

Inspired by [Cronitor](https://cronitor.io) but I just like python 🐍 more...and booty.
This is still under heavy construction 🚧. I just needed a simple free self hosted cronjob monitoring script.

## Goal
The endgoal is to write an easy to use cronjob monitoring script that sends output as:
- Discord/Telegram... etc. Anything that [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) supports (which is aloooot)
- JSON POST to any endpoint you wish
- Dead simple to use
